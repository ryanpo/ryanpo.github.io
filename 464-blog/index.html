  <h3>Intro</h3>
	<p>This page serves as the blog for the class 15-464 Technical animation. I will be making (bi)weekly updates to this blog documenting useful notes from lectures and potential ideas for a final project.</p>

  <h3>Week 1</h3>
  <p> Week 1 lectures were mostly covering course logistics and a brief introduction to what animation is. A brief history of animation was also provided and I was surprised to see how the world of animation, one that I thought was more reserved for artists, coincided with the world of academia. It is also interesting how 'style' in animation can somewhat be quantified by the techniques used. For animated movies, we often think how story-tellers and artists influence the style of the particular piece, when in fact the technical details in creating the animation is often plays a great role in the style of the result, e.g. data-driven animation.

  Although my introduction to graphics came more from the imaging/vision side, I remember that being an animator had always been on top of my list as one of my dream jobs in elementary school, my dream was soon thwarted by the quick discovery at my lack of artistic talent with pen and paper. But as I have learnt, animation is much more than that, topics such as physically accurate simulations and pose estimation are also topics that are related to animation. I look forward to this class and I especially look forward to what everyone comes up with for the final project.</p>
