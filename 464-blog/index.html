  <h3>Intro</h3>
	<p>This page serves as the blog for the class 15-464 Technical animation. I will be making (bi)weekly updates to this blog documenting useful notes from lectures and potential ideas for a final project.</p>

  <h3>Week 1</h3>
  <p> Week 1 lectures were mostly covering course logistics and a brief introduction to what animation is. A brief history of animation was also provided and I was surprised to see how the world of animation, one that I thought was more reserved for artists, coincided with the world of academia. It is also interesting how 'style' in animation can somewhat be quantified by the techniques used. For animated movies, we often think how story-tellers and artists influence the style of the particular piece, when in fact the technical details in creating the animation is often plays a great role in the style of the result, e.g. data-driven animation.

  Although my introduction to graphics came more from the imaging/vision side, I remember that being an animator had always been on top of my list as one of my dream jobs in elementary school, my dream was soon thwarted by the quick discovery at my lack of artistic talent with pen and paper. But as I have learnt, animation is much more than that, topics such as physically accurate simulations and pose estimation are also topics that are related to animation. I look forward to this class and I especially look forward to what everyone comes up with for the final project.</p>

  <h3>Week 2</h3>
  <p> Lecture 1 (2/8): In this lecture we finished up on introductions to animation and also discussed motion capture in more detail. I especially found the Panoptic Studio at CMU very interesting, though not exactly the same, this setup reminded me of the plenoptic camera, where we are leveraging multiple cameras in order to obtain more information about the scene. I did not have any experience with mo-cap data and it was interesting to see how the data was stored, I expected most of it to just be incomprehensible binary data but it turns out the way mo-cap data is presented is very intuitive in respect to how we rig models. The idea of graph based animations were also very interesting, since this was something that I've seen in Grasshoper and Unity before.
  </p>
  <p> Lecture 2 (2/10): In this lecture we started talking about IK, a topic that we briefly covered and implemented in 15-466. Since we only glossed over that topic briefly in 462, gaining a better mathematic perspective over jacobian methods in inverse kinematics was really helpful since I found this way of understanding IK was much more intuitive for me. We also spent some time discussing the first mini-project, I don't have a clear idea as to which option I am going to go for (or maybe even work on something other than the options provided) but I'm looking forward to working on it for the next few weeks. Also, I will be presenting on 'Surface-only Ferrofluids', a paper that really caught my eye, so I am looking forward to that in a few weeks time.

  <h3>Week 4</h3>
  <p> Lecture 1 (2/22): This lecture was on rigging and skinning, a topic that I had little to no prior experience in other than the little bit of animation work that we did in 15-462. Since I did most animations in 462 using a pre-rigged mesh, I did not realize how the quality of a rig really determines the quality of animations that can result from it. I was also surprised to see that neural techniques work extremely well for skinning and rigging as shown in the papers discussed in class. The neuroskin paper caught my eye, as traditional chinese clothing is notoriously hard to animate, which leads to a lot of animated chinese period pieces to look quite unnatural. However, the results shown in the paper look smooth and natural.
  </p>
  <p> Lecture 2 (2/24): This lecture was on the first set of paper presentations. Two papers that caught my eye were the ones on hand tracking and also motion retargeting. The first paper by the folks from Facebook research was particularly interesting to me since I have done a little work in hand tracking before. Occlusion and the intertwining of hands have been a particularly difficult problem to solve and this paper provides quite an elegant way of dealing with these scenarios by placing a constraint on a deformable model that is being fit on the tracked hands. The second paper on motion retargeting caught my eye simply due to the results. Being able to transfer motions from one mesh to another (with a completely different rig) means that animators may be able to reuse a lot of previous animations for other applications, which could potentially save a lot of work in animated esoteric models.

  <h3>Week 4</h3>
  <p> Lecture 1 (3/1): This lecture was on learned motion matching. It was very refreshing to see state-of-the-art research in animation is already being applied to AAA title games. Since most research in other fields require hardware development as long as theory, it may take years or even decades to see the results of research on the consumer market. The work the Ubisoft did with For Honor, was very interesting to see. After looking up gameplay footage from the game, I initially thought that most of the animations were done by hand, but since motion matching is able to achieve such fluid and natural results I can see this technique being applied to most RPGs in the future. Not only does fluid animations allow for better looking games, it also allows game designers more freedom in deciding what players can do. 
  </p>
  <p> Lecture 2 (3/3): This lecture was on MiniProject 1 presentations. I did not get the chance to present this time, but my preference was to present the 2nd MiniProject simply because I personally find simulation projects more interesting. For my own project I implemented jacobian transpose and pseudo inverse IK. Therefore, getting to see others' works on editing mocap data and keyframing was especially interesting since I did not get the chance to work on those.
