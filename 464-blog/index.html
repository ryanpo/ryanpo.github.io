  <h3>Intro</h3>
	<p>This page serves as the blog for the class 15-464 Technical animation. I will be making (bi)weekly updates to this blog documenting useful notes from lectures and potential ideas for a final project.</p>

  <h3>Week 1</h3>
  <p> Week 1 lectures were mostly covering course logistics and a brief introduction to what animation is. A brief history of animation was also provided and I was surprised to see how the world of animation, one that I thought was more reserved for artists, coincided with the world of academia. It is also interesting how 'style' in animation can somewhat be quantified by the techniques used. For animated movies, we often think how story-tellers and artists influence the style of the particular piece, when in fact the technical details in creating the animation is often plays a great role in the style of the result, e.g. data-driven animation.

  Although my introduction to graphics came more from the imaging/vision side, I remember that being an animator had always been on top of my list as one of my dream jobs in elementary school, my dream was soon thwarted by the quick discovery at my lack of artistic talent with pen and paper. But as I have learnt, animation is much more than that, topics such as physically accurate simulations and pose estimation are also topics that are related to animation. I look forward to this class and I especially look forward to what everyone comes up with for the final project.</p>

  <h3>Week 2</h3>
  <p> Lecture 1 (2/8): In this lecture we finished up on introductions to animation and also discussed motion capture in more detail. I especially found the Panoptic Studio at CMU very interesting, though not exactly the same, this setup reminded me of the plenoptic camera, where we are leveraging multiple cameras in order to obtain more information about the scene. I did not have any experience with mo-cap data and it was interesting to see how the data was stored, I expected most of it to just be incomprehensible binary data but it turns out the way mo-cap data is presented is very intuitive in respect to how we rig models. The idea of graph based animations were also very interesting, since this was something that I've seen in Grasshoper and Unity before.
  </p>
  <p> Lecture 2 (2/10): In this lecture we started talking about IK, a topic that we briefly covered and implemented in 15-466. Since we only glossed over that topic briefly in 462, gaining a better mathematic perspective over jacobian methods in inverse kinematics was really helpful since I found this way of understanding IK was much more intuitive for me. We also spent some time discussing the first mini-project, I don't have a clear idea as to which option I am going to go for (or maybe even work on something other than the options provided) but I'm looking forward to working on it for the next few weeks. Also, I will be presenting on 'Surface-only Ferrofluids', a paper that really caught my eye, so I am looking forward to that in a few weeks time.
