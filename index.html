	 	Hi there, I'm Po!
	 </h1>

	 <p>
	 	I am a junior at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Graphics.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 	My interests mostly lie in computational imaging, computational photography and graphics. This website serves as an archive for my larger <u><a href="/projects">projects</a></u> and also as a blog for my <u><a href="/mini-projects">mini-projects</a></u>. 
	 </p>

     <p>
     	I am currently working with <u><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~igkioule/">Prof. Ioannis Gkioulekas</a></u> on improving SPAD performance through optical filtering techniques as a part of the <u><a href="https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU Imaging Group</a></u>. I am also a TA for Computer Graphics (15-462) for the Spring 2021 semester.
