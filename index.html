	 	Hi there, I'm Po!
	 </h1>

	 <p>
	 	I am a senior at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Graphics and an incoming PhD student at Stanford University working with <u><a href="https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/">Prof. Gordon Wetzstein</a></u> at the <u><a href="https://www.computationalimaging.org/">Stanford Computational Imaging Lab</a></u>.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 	My interests mostly lie in computational imaging, computational photography and graphics. 
	 </p>

     <p>
     	At CMU I am working with <u><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~igkioule/">Prof. Ioannis Gkioulekas</a></u> on improving SPAD performance as a part of the <u><a href="https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/">CMU Imaging Group</a></u>. See <u><a href="https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/adaptive_gating/">here</a></u> for my most recent work on adapting gating for 3D imaging using SPADs, which has been selected for an oral presentation for CVPR 2022.
